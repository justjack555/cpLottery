Columbia U Combined Plan Lottery Predictor
Jack Ricci

Problem: The Columbia combined plan lottery guarantees 74 out of the 125-ish combined plan students housing for the
2017-2018 academic year. 3+2's are allowed to group themselves in groups ranging in size from 1 (solo) to 8. Each group
receives one (1) lottery number, so the total number of lottery numbers thrown into the hat can vary.

The question becomes: What is the optimal group size to jump into the lottery under? Fly solo? Mid-sized group of 4?
Go big or go (find a new) home with the group of 8?

The added complexity is that we have a group of 12 or so friends who all want housing. What group pairing
gets the most of us in? What group pairing offers the highest probability that we all get in (kind of obvious
but fun to confirm)? What group pairing offers me, as an individual, the highest probability of getting
housing? 2 groups of 6? 3 groups of 4? 12 solos?

I decided to build a pretty simple java program to simulate this process. The main method just calls a constructor to
build the lottery program and the groups of other kids outside of your own friend group. The other students applying
are thrown into random group sizes. The first argument when the program is run in my main takes your group size.

Needless to say, the method could be made much more generic to allow you to tinker with different group sizes and
overall lottery populations. Feel free to pull this down to your local and modify. It can serve as the basic
groundwork for any similar "lottery prediction" type of problem.

Enjoy!
